I said to ChatGPT: modify your ai-panorama.py program to be able to stitch as many images as possible. Teacher was able to stitch 7 of them.
and I gave it my full code. 
AI said: 
The real reason your teacher could stitch 7 images is likely because they:

Resized images (large images cause stitching failure)

Adjusted stitcher settings

Used better feature detection settings

Possibly tried stitching in SCANS mode

So instead of changing the structure, we’ll make it stronger and more tolerant.

✅ Improved Version That Stitches More Images

This version:

Resizes large images (very important)

Tries stitching multiple times

Uses a higher resolution setting

Is more stable


It told me to run python ai-panorama.py 1-640x480.png 2-640x480.png 3-640x480.png 4-640x480.png 5-640x480.png 6-640x480.png 7-640x480.png

but I got error code 3

I was able to run it by using  py ai-panorama.py --mode 1 1-640x480.png 2-640x480.png 3-640x480.png 4-640x480.png 5-640x480.png 6-640x480.png 7-640x480.png
